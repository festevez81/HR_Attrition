## Introduction 
In today’s competitive business landscape, understanding the factors that drive employee attrition is essential for fostering a stable and motivated workforce. The IBM HR Analytics Employee & Attrition Performance project delves into the complex dynamics of attrition, leveraging data-driven insights to empower organizations in reducing turnover rates and improving employee retention.
## Objective
The primary aim of this project is to uncover actionable insights regarding attrition trends and root causes. By combining SQL data analysis and Power BI visualizations, the project provides a comprehensive approach to identifying and addressing key drivers of employee turnover.
## Data Set 
This project is centered around a fictional dataset created by IBM Data Scientists and hosted on Kaggle. The dataset offers a rich foundation for analytical exploration, encompassing key variables such as employee demographics, job roles, compensation, tenure, and other critical factors that influence attrition

## Approach
Approach:
1.	SQL Data Analysis: 
•	Extract and transform relevant data to support the analysis.
•	Generate key metrics, such as attrition rates segmented by department or tenure.

2.	Power BI Visualization: 
•	Present findings through interactive dashboards and visuals that are easy to interpret.
•	Utilize visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, or other formats suitable for highlighting trends and key insights related to attrition and payroll analysis.
•	Design the dashboards to ensure clarity and usability, focusing on accessibility for stakeholders.

Expected Outcomes:
•	Comprehensive payroll analysis to uncover potential correlations between compensation and attrition rates.
•	Clear identification of the primary drivers of attrition.
•	Implementation of strategies derived from the analysis to improve employee retention.


## SQL Documentation 

Introduction

This project focuses on the SQL integration within the broader analysis of employee attrition. SQL has been utilized as a powerful tool to extract, transform, and prepare data from the underlying database, ensuring seamless integration with Power BI for advanced visualization and insights.

The main goal is to leverage SQL queries to:

•	Retrieve key datasets related to employees, attrition, promotions, and overtime.
•	Perform necessary transformations and aggregations to enhance data usability for further analysis.
•	Build efficient data pipelines that optimize performance and ensure accuracy when linking SQL to Power BI.

This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how SQL was implemented, including the structure of the database, key queries, optimization strategies, and its role in achieving actionable insights into employee retention patterns.
